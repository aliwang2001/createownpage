# Creating a personal or group page
Hello! For this task, you will have to allocate around 15-30 minutes of your time.
For the GitHub repository, you will have to download all contents to be able to view your site as you are updating the html file. 

I have commented certain sections in the html file for you to edit. 

If you are creating a group page, please open the grouppages folder. You will find the html file to edit there. Name it accordingly.
If you are creating a personal page, please open the personalpages folder. You will find the html file to edit there. Name it accordingly.

After you are done with your edits, please delete all other items except for the html page and the image folder. Please upload the entire folder [here.](https://goo.gl/forms/ln45PBEZqTtxl0w23)

# A little bit about HTML

```html
<a href= "PUT A LINK HERE">This is the text that will show</a>
<p> This is a paragraph! </p>
<h3> This is a title! </h3>
```
The following are all tags. They will have text in between them, and end with the same tag except with a slash.

When editing words, please edit between the tags.

In order to add images:

You can upload your image into the image folder. Put the path into the first set of quotation marks.

```html
<img src="../images/example.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
```
If you are using an outside image source, just Copy the image's address and pase into the first set of quotation marks.

```html
<img src="PASTE LINK HERE" class="img-responsive" alt="Single Project">
```
For making titles, use tags such as "<h3>" and "<h4>". "<h4>" will be noticeably bolder and bigger. Close the tags after text.

For making paragraphs, use the tags "<p>" and "</p>".

```html
<h4>This is a title</h4>
<p>This is the following paragraph</p>
```
